##closestPair
========

Run command:

./closestPair.rb n

The command line parameter n decides the problem size and must be provided.  The program will run all three algorithms, and provide a run time for each.

The script closestPairRun.sh runs the closestPair program for increasing problem sizes, outputting the runtime data to a file for graphing.
